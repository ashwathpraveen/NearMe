    <h2>About Amaravathi Dam</h2>
    <image src="amaravathi-dam.jpg">
        <p> Location: Amaravathi Dam is built across the Amaravathi River at Amaravathinagar, about 25 km south of
            Udumalpet, in the Indira Gandhi Wildlife Sanctuary, Tiruppur district.
            Purpose: It was constructed in 1957 primarily for irrigation and flood control.
            Reservoir details: The Amaravathi Reservoir has an area of about 9.31 km² and a maximum depth of ~33.53 m.
            Power generation: The dam also has a hydroelectric component of 4 MW capacity.
            Agriculture: The dam plays a crucial role in irrigating large areas — across Tiruppur and Karur districts.
            Drinking water: Water from Amaravathi also supports local drinking water schemes.
            Wildlife: The dam and its catchment basin support a significant population of Mugger crocodiles.
            Scenery & tourism facilities: There is a park near the dam. Visitors can climb steep steps on the dam to
            enjoy panoramic views — north toward the plains, south toward the Anaimalai and Palani Hills.</p>

            Hills region, Udumalpet / Tiruppur district
            Panchalinga Falls: The waterfall is also called Panchalinga Falls. It’s about 3 km uphill from the temple.
            CityBit Travel
            Scenery: The path is scenic, surrounded by hills (part of the Western Ghats), paddy fields, coconut groves
            and in some write-ups sunflower gardens.
            Temple: The Amanalingeswarar Temple is at the foot of the hill, adjacent to the dam. The waterfall flows
            beside this temple.
            Best time to visit: Winter and post-monsoon months (October to March) when water flow is good. During peak
            summer the falls may have much less water.</p>

            Significance:
            It honours Tiruppur Kumaran, also called Kodi Kaatha Kumaran (meaning “Kumaran who protected the flag”), who
            died on 11 January 1932 after being injured by police during a protest march in Tiruppur, while holding the
            banned Indian national flag.
            The pillar marks the place where Kumaran was attacked by the British police.</p>
